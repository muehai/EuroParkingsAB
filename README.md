# ParkingGarage
Creating the parking application was to demonistrate the .net core 2 components to
build asp.net MVC core website and the migration aspects. Beyond that I not going to explain the details for this project because it's self explanatory.

The result of implementing the parking application is showing in these pictures. The pictures speaks for itself.
